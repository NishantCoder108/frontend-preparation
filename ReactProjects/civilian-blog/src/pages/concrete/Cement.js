      <h3>Functions of Different Constituents of Cement</h3>
      <small>
        What is mean by soundness of concrete?
        <br />
        The soundness of cement refers to the stability of the volume change in
        the process of setting and hardening. If the volume change is unstable
        after setting and hardening, the concrete structures will crack, which
        can affect the quality of buildings or even cause serious accidents,
        known as poor dimensional stability.
      </small>
      <h2>1.Lime (62-65%)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Imparts(प्रदान) strength and Soundness.</li>
        <li>
          Excess - It becomes difficult to combine with other compounds ,Free
          lime will be present in clinkers(धातुमल) which makes cement unsound ,
          <br />
          Causes it to expand & disintegrate(बिखर).{" "}

      <h2>2.Silica(17-25%)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Imparts Strength to Cement</li>
        <li>
          Excess - Increase strength of cement but Increase setting time of
          cement.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3.Alumina(3-8%)</h2>

      <h2>7.Sulphur(1-3%)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is also responsible for imparting soundness . <br /> Note
          :Soundness due to lime and Magnesia can be measured directly but no
          test is available to measure soundness due to sulphur.{" "}
